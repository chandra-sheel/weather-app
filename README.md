#### Created a weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides real-time weather information for a given location using an API. Implemented features such as displaying current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Utilized the weather API to fetch accurate weather data and designed an intuitive user interface for a smooth user experience.
